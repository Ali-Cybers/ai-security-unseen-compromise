**AI Security in Practice: Operationalising Risk, Regulation, and Enforceable Controls**  
**Author:** Ali Nouman  
**Audience:** CISOs, security leaders, and risk professionals across UK organisations

## Overview

This repository contains a practitioner research paper examining how artificial intelligence is already reshaping the cyber risk landscape inside UK organisations.

The focus is not theoretical AI risk or future speculation.  
It addresses the operational reality security leaders are dealing with today.

AI tools are already embedded in daily business workflows.  
Data is being processed in ways most organisations cannot fully see.  
Security controls were designed for infrastructure, not AI-driven workflows.  
Regulation increases accountability but does not provide security by itself.

The central argument is simple.  
The biggest AI risk is not adoption, but uncontrolled adoption.

This work focuses on how organisations can extend existing cybersecurity controls to cover AI systems that are already in use.
