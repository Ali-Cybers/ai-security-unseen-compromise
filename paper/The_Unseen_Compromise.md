Executive Summary: The Compromise We’ve Already Accepted
Here is the truth that sits uncomfortably in every security leader’s Monday morning: we have already lost visibility and effective control over how AI is being used in our organisations.
AI is not coming. It is already here, working quietly at employee desks while governance frameworks are debated in committees.
While boards discuss AI strategy in quarterly meetings, millions of UK workers are already using generative AI tools for work, often without formal approval or security oversight. This is not shadow IT. It is ambient AI. It is embedded in tools approved for other purposes, available through platforms organisations already pay for, and woven into the fabric of how work actually gets done.
The gap is not between awareness and action. It is between the AI organisations believe they govern and the AI actually being used.
This paper focuses on closing that gap, not through new frameworks, but by extending existing security controls to cover the AI that is already running.

1. The UK Threat Landscape: When Speed Becomes the Weapon
What is changing across UK organisations is not the nature of cyber threats, but their velocity.
Ransomware has not changed shape, but it has changed speed. The UK National Cyber Security Centre continues to handle hundreds of serious incidents annually, with criminal groups operating at industrial scale.
•	The numbers illustrate the problem clearly.
•	The average cost of a data breach in the UK is £3.4 million.
•	The average time to identify a breach remains around 207 days.
•	At the same time, AI-enhanced attacks can move from initial access to data exfiltration in hours to days.
Security teams are defending human-paced processes against machine-speed adversaries. The margin for error no longer exists.

2. Ambient AI: The Inventory That Does Not Exist
Consider a simple question. How many AI models are processing your organisation’s data right now?
If the answer is a precise number, it is likely incorrect. If the answer is “I don’t know,” it is honest and common.
Across UK organisations, security teams are typically aware of less than 30 percent of the AI tools actually in use. A typical mid-sized business has between eight and twelve different AI services processing company data at any given time.
These tools rarely arrive through formal procurement. They appear through default-enabled SaaS features, browser extensions installed by developers, free-tier accounts created by individuals, and APIs embedded into automation platforms.
A particularly concerning statistic is that 67 percent of UK professionals admit to pasting sensitive company data into public AI tools. This behaviour is rarely malicious. It is efficient. And efficiency consistently wins over policy.
We often find that the AI security conversation starts with a simple traffic report. When leadership sees the actual API calls leaving their network, not the approved ones, but the real ones, the theoretical discussion becomes operational immediately.

3. Three Realities Security Teams Commonly Miss
Data Leakage by Workflow
In 2023, Samsung engineers reportedly leaked proprietary chip designs via ChatGPT on multiple occasions. This was not a breach in the traditional sense. It was a workflow. A tool designed to accelerate innovation became the mechanism for intellectual property loss.
Industry analysis predicts that by 2025, the majority of enterprise data will be processed outside traditional security perimeters, not through negligence, but through normal business operations.
Prompt Injection as Corporate Espionage
Techniques that bypass AI safety controls are actively traded in underground forums. These attacks are not classic exploits. They are social engineering executed at API scale.
An attacker can embed malicious instructions in publicly accessible content. When an internal AI system processes that content, it may execute unintended actions, including data exfiltration. The attack surface is no longer the firewall. It is any text the AI might read.
The Supply Chain of Unknowns
When AI vendors experience security incidents, customer organisations may be exposed through no fault of their own. Research shows that most organisations using third-party AI models have never assessed the underlying model provider’s infrastructure or data handling practices.
As a result, organisations outsource decision-making to systems they do not fully understand and cannot meaningfully audit.

4. Regulation: The Scaffolding, Not the Building
The EU AI Act will enforce accountability, mandate inventories, and require transparency. This is necessary, but insufficient.
Regulation defines what must be documented. It does not provide operational control.
Security leaders who succeed will use regulation as leverage rather than as a compliance exercise. Data governance requirements can justify investment in classification and monitoring. Transparency obligations can be used to demand clarity from vendors. Human oversight requirements can support appropriate staffing and ownership models.
In the UK, regulators are already enforcing data protection principles in AI contexts. Enforcement action demonstrates that responsibility applies regardless of which tool processes the data.

5. The Control Extension Framework
Most organisations already operate mature security controls. The challenge is extending them to AI use cases.
Asset management systems track infrastructure but not APIs or models. Data loss prevention tools protect email and file transfers but not prompts. Identity systems manage people but not AI agents. Vendor risk processes assess suppliers but not model training pipelines.
AI security becomes manageable when existing controls are extended rather than replaced. Prompts must be treated as data exports. AI interactions must be logged as API calls. Model outputs must be recognised as potential data leaks.

6. The 90-Day Survival Sprint
This is not a transformation programme. It is a visibility and control sprint designed to stabilise reality.
Days 1 to 30: See What Is Actually Happening
The first month is about truth, not judgement.
Start by analysing outbound traffic to known AI services. This single step usually reveals more AI usage than any survey or policy review ever will. Most teams are surprised by what shows up in the logs.
At the same time, run a simple internal amnesty. Ask teams one direct question: Which AI tools help you get your job done faster? Make it clear this is not about enforcement. It is about understanding how work really happens.
End the month with a short, practical usage guide. Not a policy document. A clear green, amber, red view of AI tools that people can actually follow.
Days 31 to 60: Create Ownership and Reduce Risk
Once visibility exists, responsibility must follow.
Assign clear ownership for AI security and governance, even if it is only part of someone’s role. Without an owner, AI risk becomes everyone’s problem and no one’s priority.
Next, categorise AI use cases by data sensitivity. Public data. Internal data. Customer or regulated data. Focus attention where the consequences matter most.
Use this window to update vendor contracts and procurement language. AI clauses around data usage, training rights, auditability, and breach notification are no longer optional. This is where governance starts to become enforceable.
Days 61 to 90: Make Control Real
The final phase is where credibility is built.
Deploy one meaningful technical control that reduces real risk. This might be an AI gateway, DLP coverage for prompts, or an approved internal AI environment that gives staff a safer alternative.
Run a realistic tabletop exercise based on how AI is actually used in the organisation. Not a theoretical scenario. A simple one: An employee uploaded sensitive data to an external AI service. The vendor has disclosed an incident. What do we do next?
Finally, build a small evidence pack. Not for auditors, but for leadership. A snapshot of what is visible, what is controlled, and what is improving. This becomes the baseline for everything that follows.
The goal of the 90-day sprint is not maturity. It is control. Once control exists, improvement becomes possible.

7. Conclusion: The Choice That Defines Your Legacy
AI security is not primarily a technical problem. It is a leadership test.
Organisations can choose compliance theatre, producing policies that fail to cover real usage until an incident occurs. Or they can choose resilience, using AI adoption as the catalyst to finally address long-standing data governance challenges.
AI is already operating inside organisational boundaries. The only remaining question is whether security leaders will control it in practice or only on paper.
Trust will define success in an AI-driven economy. Security leadership is how that trust is earned.

About This Research
This paper reflects extensive work across UK organisations, including technical assessments of AI security controls, analysis of regulatory developments, and hands-on implementation of the approaches described.
The recommendations reflect what works in live environments rather than theoretical models.
The urgency is real. Data flows do not wait for compliance timelines.
